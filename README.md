# Logistic-Regression-Student-Performance

Education plays a crucial role in determining whether an individual will grow up to have a stable, well-paying job. Much of the jobs today require specialized skills to obtain so it is essential for students to excel academically. Studying student academic performance could give us insights into how teachers / parents could improve a student's final grade scores.

The purpose of this project is to understand how factors like a student’s social, economic, and personal background can influence the student’s final grade in a Portuguese course. We will use logistic regression to create a model that can predict whether a student will pass or fail based on the most important factors.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the application of logistic regression in a real-world problem, and provide insights into how machine learning can be used to improve student outcomes.
